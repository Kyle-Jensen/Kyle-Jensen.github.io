                            For our project we are examining Major League Baseball statistics from
                            2014-2015 that were sourced from <u>Kaggle.com</u>. We will be
                            investigating correlations between teams wins while considering other
                            variables. The resources we are using to examine the data are Tableau
                            and Excel. This is to assist in visualizing the data using graphs and
                            charts, as well as performing regression analysis on the data set.

                        <strong>Purpose:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of our project is to compare our dependent variable which is
                        wins and compare them against other variables, such as attendance and runs
                        allowed. We also want to find out if other variables have an effect on
                        wins. Our goal as we examined this dataset ultimately is to figure out what
                        variables have an impact on wins. We will determine our goals by utilizing
                        graphs, statistical measures, regression, and hypothesis testing.
                        Furthermore, we will analyze the various results of the visuals and the
                        statistical analyses to determine our overall recommendations and
                        conclusions on how teams are winning, how to increase team’s overall wins,
                        and teams’ popularities
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">
                        <strong>Description of the Dataset:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As stated above, our dataset is comprised of multiple stats from major
                        league baseball teams during 2014 and 2015. The dataset we will be
                        analyzing has a total of 48 variables. We found it easier to divide the
                        variables into offensive and defensive statistics. The offensive variables
                        we thought would have the most potential effect on wins are: hits, 2b, 3b,
                        and homeruns. Hits are described as how often a team hits the ball and gets
                        on base. We are using the abbreviations 2b and 3b to describe doubles and
                        triples, which is how often a team gets a hit and makes it to second and
                        third base respectively. It would make sense that these variables have a
                        strong impact on wins because a team should be more likely to win if they
                        have more opportunities on base, which may lead to more runs scored.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The defensive variables we thought would have the most effect on wins are
                        hits allowed, runs allowed, and earned runs. If a team has a high number of
                        hits allowed and a low number of earned runs, then we believe that the team
                        would have a high number of wins. We also hypothesized that if a team does
                        not allow many hits, walks, and runs, then they would have a better chance
                        of winning more often.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We did an initial analysis of descriptive measures for team wins in each of
                        the years. The table can be seen below. We found that wins are normally
                        distributed with a slight positive skewed and a wide degree of dispersion
                        (kurtosis). Mean, standard deviation, and variance do not seem to differ
                        too much from year to year.

                            The baseball team data for years 2014 and 2015 have various variables that
                            could potentially correlate with team/franchise wins, such as different
                            types of hits, overall hits, hits allowed, and many more. However, not all
                            the variables within this dataset fit our overall goals and purposes. For
                            example, the dataset contains repetitive nominal data that are qualitative,
                            such as variables for franchise, team, and retro. Therefore, sticking with
                            variables and attributes that are numerical and discrete will allows us to
                            further our analyses on different impactors of team/franchise wins. In
                            addition, to fit the scope of the project, we will be correlating 5
                            different variables for wins. We will begin with comparing offensive
                            variables/stats of different teams to see if there is actual statistical
                            evidence that shows the reason why teams are winning. A great variable to
                            begin with would be the total hits of each team. Through hypothesis
                            testing, if there is a linear relationship that appears for hits and wins,
                            then we will further our analysis on different types of hits; such as
                            double hits, triple hits, and homeruns. The next goal for our analysis will
                            be to investigate defensive variables/stats. We will instigate hits allowed
                            and then further our analysis with other defensive variables/stats, such as
                            runs allowed and earned runs. Lastly, we will determine if there is any
                            relation between overall attendance and wins.

                                    Analyzing the scatter chart and the regression/ANOVA output shows there to
                                    be an extremely weak linear relationship if any at all. The R-squared in
                                    the summary output shows to be at .0288, which is extremely low when
                                    comparing the 0-1 scale for R-squared. This shows that the goodness-of-fit
                                    is extremely poor, with almost no variability of the response data around
                                    its mean. Also, an example from the dataset shows that in year 2014,
                                    Seattle Mariners had 87 wins and 1328 hits while Tampa Bay Rays had 77 wins
                                    and 1361 hits. There are many other teams with similar outcomes and this
                                    shows why the goodness-of-fit is poor. This also shows why offensive
                                    variables/stats are a bad predictor and impactor for wins as many other
                                    similar variables have the same outcomes. Next, the p-value (Significance
                                    F) is surprisingly high. The p-value is at .1951, which is significantly
                                    higher than .05. When checking the p-value for the hypothesis testing, 1951
                                    &lt; .05 is not true, therefore the null hypothesis is not rejected. The
                                    alternative shows to be not true, and then therefore, there is not a linear
                                    relationship between hits and wins. Ultimately, this shows offensive
                                    variables/stats of different teams have little to no impact when it comes
                                    to wins. This information also shows that there’s no reason to further our
                                    analysis with other offensive variables/stats, such as double hits, triples
                                    hits, and home-runs since the variables/stats have a high variability. For
                                    a double hits example, in year 2014, the Baltimore Orioles had 264 double
                                    hits and 96 wins while the San Diego Padres had 260 double hits with 74
                                    wins. Triple hits and home-runs also have similar outcomes.

                                    The first defensive variable/stat shows there to be a negative linear
                                    relationship with y = -0.0724x + 182.05. This result makes sense because
                                    teams with higher number of wins allow less hits for the opposing team. For
                                    example, in year 2015, the St. Louis Cardinals had 100 wins with only 1359
                                    hits allowed. Also, in the same year the Philadelphia Phillies had the
                                    highest hits allowed at 1592 with 63 wins. They happen to be the team with
                                    the lowest number of wins throughout the MLB. Furthermore, this
                                    demonstration has a decent goodness-of-fit since the R-squared is at .3488
                                    and shows that some variability of the response is around its mean. Next,
                                    the p-value is shown to be extremely low and is evidently under .05.
                                    Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and shows that there is an
                                    existing linear relationship between these variables. Having an adequate
                                    goodness-to-fit and proof of significance of there being a linear
                                    relationship shows that hits allowed for teams is a good predictor and
                                    impactor for overall wins in the MLB.

    This statistical analysis is similar to Hits Allowed Vs. Wins as it’s
    another negative linear regression (y = -0.1047x + 151.47). A team with
    lower runs allowed tend to win more baseball games. This regression has
    another decently high R-squared, which is at .573. The trend line in the
    scatter chart demonstrates that this statistical test has a good fit with
    the wins and runs allowed. The p-value in this demonstration is also well
    below .05. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and shows that there
    is an existing linear relationship between these variables. Lastly, the
    goodness-of-fit and acceptance of the alternative hypothesis shows that
    this demonstration is a good predictor for wins.

    Clarification of what earned runs are: It’s any run that scored against a
    pitcher without the benefit of an error, so therefore it’s a defensive
    variable/stat. Once again, the linear equation is negative (y = -5.2276x +
    1043). All defensive variables/stats should be negatively linear due to the
    dependent and independent variables having an inverse relationship between
    the two. This last statistical test for defensive variables/stats also
    shows to have a goodness-of-fit due to the R-squared being .5562.
    Ultimately, Runs Allowed Vs. Wins and Earned Runs Vs. Wins show to have a
    lot of variability of the response data around its mean. Also, the p-value
    for this test is once again significantly below .05, then therefore we
    reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that shows
    there’s a linear relationship between the two variables. Earned runs shows
    to be a good predictor due to a high R-squared and proven linear regression
    through hypothesis testing.
