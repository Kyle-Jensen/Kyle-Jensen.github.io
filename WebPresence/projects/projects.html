                            For our project we are examining Major League Baseball statistics from
                            2014-2015 that were sourced from <u>Kaggle.com</u>. We will be
                            investigating correlations between teams wins while considering other
                            variables. The resources we are using to examine the data are Tableau
                            and Excel. This is to assist in visualizing the data using graphs and
                            charts, as well as performing regression analysis on the data set.

                        <strong>Purpose:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of our project is to compare our dependent variable which is
                        wins and compare them against other variables, such as attendance and runs
                        allowed. We also want to find out if other variables have an effect on
                        wins. Our goal as we examined this dataset ultimately is to figure out what
                        variables have an impact on wins. We will determine our goals by utilizing
                        graphs, statistical measures, regression, and hypothesis testing.
                        Furthermore, we will analyze the various results of the visuals and the
                        statistical analyses to determine our overall recommendations and
                        conclusions on how teams are winning, how to increase team’s overall wins,
                        and teams’ popularities
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">
                        <strong>Description of the Dataset:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As stated above, our dataset is comprised of multiple stats from major
                        league baseball teams during 2014 and 2015. The dataset we will be
                        analyzing has a total of 48 variables. We found it easier to divide the
                        variables into offensive and defensive statistics. The offensive variables
                        we thought would have the most potential effect on wins are: hits, 2b, 3b,
                        and homeruns. Hits are described as how often a team hits the ball and gets
                        on base. We are using the abbreviations 2b and 3b to describe doubles and
                        triples, which is how often a team gets a hit and makes it to second and
                        third base respectively. It would make sense that these variables have a
                        strong impact on wins because a team should be more likely to win if they
                        have more opportunities on base, which may lead to more runs scored.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The defensive variables we thought would have the most effect on wins are
                        hits allowed, runs allowed, and earned runs. If a team has a high number of
                        hits allowed and a low number of earned runs, then we believe that the team
                        would have a high number of wins. We also hypothesized that if a team does
                        not allow many hits, walks, and runs, then they would have a better chance
                        of winning more often.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We did an initial analysis of descriptive measures for team wins in each of
                        the years. The table can be seen below. We found that wins are normally
                        distributed with a slight positive skewed and a wide degree of dispersion
                        (kurtosis). Mean, standard deviation, and variance do not seem to differ
                        too much from year to year.

                            The baseball team data for years 2014 and 2015 have various variables that
                            could potentially correlate with team/franchise wins, such as different
                            types of hits, overall hits, hits allowed, and many more. However, not all
                            the variables within this dataset fit our overall goals and purposes. For
                            example, the dataset contains repetitive nominal data that are qualitative,
                            such as variables for franchise, team, and retro. Therefore, sticking with
                            variables and attributes that are numerical and discrete will allows us to
                            further our analyses on different impactors of team/franchise wins. In
                            addition, to fit the scope of the project, we will be correlating 5
                            different variables for wins. We will begin with comparing offensive
                            variables/stats of different teams to see if there is actual statistical
                            evidence that shows the reason why teams are winning. A great variable to
                            begin with would be the total hits of each team. Through hypothesis
                            testing, if there is a linear relationship that appears for hits and wins,
                            then we will further our analysis on different types of hits; such as
                            double hits, triple hits, and homeruns. The next goal for our analysis will
                            be to investigate defensive variables/stats. We will instigate hits allowed
                            and then further our analysis with other defensive variables/stats, such as
                            runs allowed and earned runs. Lastly, we will determine if there is any
                            relation between overall attendance and wins.

                                    Analyzing the scatter chart and the regression/ANOVA output shows there to
                                    be an extremely weak linear relationship if any at all. The R-squared in
                                    the summary output shows to be at .0288, which is extremely low when
                                    comparing the 0-1 scale for R-squared. This shows that the goodness-of-fit
                                    is extremely poor, with almost no variability of the response data around
                                    its mean. Also, an example from the dataset shows that in year 2014,
                                    Seattle Mariners had 87 wins and 1328 hits while Tampa Bay Rays had 77 wins
                                    and 1361 hits. There are many other teams with similar outcomes and this
                                    shows why the goodness-of-fit is poor. This also shows why offensive
                                    variables/stats are a bad predictor and impactor for wins as many other
                                    similar variables have the same outcomes. Next, the p-value (Significance
                                    F) is surprisingly high. The p-value is at .1951, which is significantly
                                    higher than .05. When checking the p-value for the hypothesis testing, 1951
                                    &lt; .05 is not true, therefore the null hypothesis is not rejected. The
                                    alternative shows to be not true, and then therefore, there is not a linear
                                    relationship between hits and wins. Ultimately, this shows offensive
                                    variables/stats of different teams have little to no impact when it comes
                                    to wins. This information also shows that there’s no reason to further our
                                    analysis with other offensive variables/stats, such as double hits, triples
                                    hits, and home-runs since the variables/stats have a high variability. For
                                    a double hits example, in year 2014, the Baltimore Orioles had 264 double
                                    hits and 96 wins while the San Diego Padres had 260 double hits with 74
                                    wins. Triple hits and home-runs also have similar outcomes.

                                    The first defensive variable/stat shows there to be a negative linear
                                    relationship with y = -0.0724x + 182.05. This result makes sense because
                                    teams with higher number of wins allow less hits for the opposing team. For
                                    example, in year 2015, the St. Louis Cardinals had 100 wins with only 1359
                                    hits allowed. Also, in the same year the Philadelphia Phillies had the
                                    highest hits allowed at 1592 with 63 wins. They happen to be the team with
                                    the lowest number of wins throughout the MLB. Furthermore, this
                                    demonstration has a decent goodness-of-fit since the R-squared is at .3488
                                    and shows that some variability of the response is around its mean. Next,
                                    the p-value is shown to be extremely low and is evidently under .05.
                                    Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and shows that there is an
                                    existing linear relationship between these variables. Having an adequate
                                    goodness-to-fit and proof of significance of there being a linear
                                    relationship shows that hits allowed for teams is a good predictor and
                                    impactor for overall wins in the MLB.

    This statistical analysis is similar to Hits Allowed Vs. Wins as it’s
    another negative linear regression (y = -0.1047x + 151.47). A team with
    lower runs allowed tend to win more baseball games. This regression has
    another decently high R-squared, which is at .573. The trend line in the
    scatter chart demonstrates that this statistical test has a good fit with
    the wins and runs allowed. The p-value in this demonstration is also well
    below .05. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and shows that there
    is an existing linear relationship between these variables. Lastly, the
    goodness-of-fit and acceptance of the alternative hypothesis shows that
    this demonstration is a good predictor for wins.

<p>
    Clarification of what earned runs are: It’s any run that scored against a
    pitcher without the benefit of an error, so therefore it’s a defensive
    variable/stat. Once again, the linear equation is negative (y = -5.2276x +
    1043). All defensive variables/stats should be negatively linear due to the
    dependent and independent variables having an inverse relationship between
    the two. This last statistical test for defensive variables/stats also
    shows to have a goodness-of-fit due to the R-squared being .5562.
    Ultimately, Runs Allowed Vs. Wins and Earned Runs Vs. Wins show to have a
    lot of variability of the response data around its mean. Also, the p-value
    for this test is once again significantly below .05, then therefore we
    reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that shows
    there’s a linear relationship between the two variables. Earned runs shows
    to be a good predictor due to a high R-squared and proven linear regression
    through hypothesis testing.

        The last statistical analysis that is looked at is Attendance Vs. Wins. The
        R-squared in this test also seems to be low, which has evidently impacted
        the goodness-to-fit for the graph. Next, the p-value for this example is
        significantly low and below .05. The null hypothesis is once again
        rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is approved and therefore is shown
        to have significance and a linear relationship. By looking at the
        evidential information, attendance for a ballpark does increase with higher
        number of wins in a franchise.

    <p align="left">
        <strong>Recommendations:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Baseball teams can be split into two separate categories; offense and
        defense. For our analysis the focus was on which is more important to earn
        wins for the team. Does having a weak defense but a strong offense offer a
        better chance at winning more games, or does a strong defense but a weak
        offense offer a better opportunity? In this section we are focusing on the
        offensive stats recommendation, the defensive stats recommendations and
        then the most important non-game stat for teams, the attendance for the
        games.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our analysis found that there is no significant relationship amongst hits
        and wins. Furthermore, if there was conclusive evidence, then there’s an
        extremely weak goodness-of-fit that shows to be extremely poor with no
        variability. As mentioned earlier, in 2014, the Rays got 33 more hits
        during the season over the Mariners (the Mariners had 10 more wins). This
        shows that recommendations for teams do not concentrate solely on hits as
        they do not, at least statistically, mean a greater chance of winning. The
        reason that the other offensive variables vs wins wasn’t included was
        because they didn’t have a significant enough impact on the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having a strong offense that includes hits, 1B, 2B, 3B, and runs does not
        mean a team can always win as there is not a high correlation between them
        as visualized below. Also, we noticed that the top three and bottom three
        teams with the highest hits in 2014 and 2015 did not necessarily have the
        highest or lowest number of wins. For example, STL had the highest number
        of wins in 2015 but did not have the highest number of hits (1,368). In the
        same year, CIN having one of the lowest number of wins managed to have more
        hits than STL. This furthers the strengthening of the fact that a strong
        offense doesn’t necessarily make teams win, rather both a strong defense
        coupled with a strong offense will better their chances.

        Getting more runs than the other team is how you win in a game of baseball,
        one method to achieve that is to prevent the other team from scoring. The
        stats that were analyzed for the defense of the MLB teams include
        regression analysis of Hits allowed vs Wins, Runs allowed vs Wins, and Runs
        Earned vs Wins. Comparing the three based from R-squared shows that the
        strongest is the Runs Allowed vs Wins. This analysis makes sense as the
        less runs you give up the more likely you are to win, this applies to both
        teams in the same game though. Some recommendations to make for teams to
        help prevent Runs allowed would include focusing less on pitching and more
        on infield play, devoting extra practice time to preventing the number of
        allowed bases per hit, and to focus on preventing steals and walks.

        While the prevention of hits is important to preventing overall scores, the
        likelihood of a no-hit game based off the data we had would be 0.25%.
        Therefore, teams shouldn’t be focusing on allowing no hits during a game,
        but rather to prevent the players that do hit from scoring. This can be
        achieved by focusing less on pitching perfect games and more on the infield
        and outfield play. The number of runs could potentially be greatly cut down
        if teams increase the time and money spent on their training of inner field
        play, as well as outfield play. With that said, improved pitching is still
        a great benefactor for increased wins for a team. Another key point to
        focus on rather than keeping down runs is to prevent the runner from making
        it past first base. Lastly, the number of hits doesn’t include walks, but
        walks can lead to scores depending on other hits and steals from the team.
        While a team might not strike out, the number of players aiming to score
        can be cut down by the prevention of walks.

        In reference to the graph below, you can see that the defensive variables
        (Hits allowed, Runs Allowed, Earned Runs) are incredibly important for
        increasing wins for MLB teams. The top 3 teams based on wins had on average
        200 less hits, allowed as well as 200 less runs throughout the season.

        While winning is the most important statistic for the team, revenue is the
        most important aspect for the owners of the teams. A big contribution
        towards revenue is brought in by the game tickets, concessions, and on-site
        merchandise. The amount of revenue brought in is affected by the number of
        fans attending the games throughout the season. While most of the research
        and analysis completed was focused on how teams are more likely to earn
        wins. There was also regression analysis done on whether attendance
        affected the number of wins. The R-squared at a mere 0.19 showed that there
        wasn’t a strong linear regression between the two variables. This means
        that getting more wins throughout the season doesn’t guarantee of increased
        attendance. The in-game statistics do not have a correlation with
        attendance, so instead, companies should focus more on advertisement,
        offering discounts or deals, or to expand on the number of seats if they’re
        reaching capacity to ensure more seats are available for fans.

        <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
        <strong><u></u></strong>
    </p>

        An initial analysis of the set of MLB data found that Wins were normally
        distributed with a slight positive skew and wide degree of dispersion,
        mean, standard deviation, and variance that showed to differ from year to
        year. A thorough analysis of the data set allowed us to determine impactors
        for our dependent variable (wins) from the selected independent variables
        (Hits, Hits Allowed, Runs Allowed, Earned Runs, and Attendance). The
        analysis showed that the variables that lead towards runs (Hits, 1B, 2B,
        3B, Home runs, etc.) were not as statistically correlated to getting wins
        as the variables that lead to preventing runs (Hits Allowed, Runs Allowed,
        Earned Runs). For this process, the data was utilized through a linear
        regression within Excel to find trend lines, R-squared, and p-values.
        Utilizing these statistical measures allowed linear regression hypothesis
        testing that demonstrated when either a linear or a non-linear relationship
        existed. This process allowed analysis and observances of possible
        correlations between wins and our independent variables. Utilizing our
        regression models and hypotheses testing allowed our group to determine
        that the defensive variables such as hits allowed, runs allowed, and earned
        runs allowed would have a great effect on wins while discontinuing our
        statistical analysis on offensive stats due to conclusive evidence for lack
        of correlation. Since the offensive variables aren’t as correlated to wins
        as the defensive variables, our recommendations leaned more towards
        defensive options. Teams should focus more on defensive strategies such as
        earned runs, runs allowed, hits allowed, and prevention since these have
        more of an impact on their chances of winning. This doesn’t mean that teams
        should completely stop working on hitting and running, but these additional
        resources shouldn’t be their main priority to their current routine. At the
        very basic level, teams should focus more on preventing runs first and
        preventing hits second. There are several ways to prevent these, including
        focusing on infield play, fly ball catches, preventing walks, and limiting
        the number of bases earned by hits.

        Team owners have two primary areas to focus on, their teams getting wins,
        and making money. We have already covered what to do to achieve more wins,
        but how can an owner make their team more profitable. A statistic provided
        by our data set included the yearly attendance for each team. Through
        analysis we found that the R-squared for attendance vs wins was weak at
        .19. If a team’s winning does not improve the attendance, then what would?
        We recommended that team owners focus on either improving the amount made
        during a ballgame by concessions and merchandise sales or to focus on
        outside factors to draw a larger crowd.
