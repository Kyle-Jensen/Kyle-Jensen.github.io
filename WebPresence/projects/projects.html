                            For our project we are examining Major League Baseball statistics from
                            2014-2015 that were sourced from <u>Kaggle.com</u>. We will be
                            investigating correlations between teams wins while considering other
                            variables. The resources we are using to examine the data are Tableau
                            and Excel. This is to assist in visualizing the data using graphs and
                            charts, as well as performing regression analysis on the data set.

                        <strong>Purpose:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of our project is to compare our dependent variable which is
                        wins and compare them against other variables, such as attendance and runs
                        allowed. We also want to find out if other variables have an effect on
                        wins. Our goal as we examined this dataset ultimately is to figure out what
                        variables have an impact on wins. We will determine our goals by utilizing
                        graphs, statistical measures, regression, and hypothesis testing.
                        Furthermore, we will analyze the various results of the visuals and the
                        statistical analyses to determine our overall recommendations and
                        conclusions on how teams are winning, how to increase team’s overall wins,
                        and teams’ popularities
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">
                        <strong>Description of the Dataset:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As stated above, our dataset is comprised of multiple stats from major
                        league baseball teams during 2014 and 2015. The dataset we will be
                        analyzing has a total of 48 variables. We found it easier to divide the
                        variables into offensive and defensive statistics. The offensive variables
                        we thought would have the most potential effect on wins are: hits, 2b, 3b,
                        and homeruns. Hits are described as how often a team hits the ball and gets
                        on base. We are using the abbreviations 2b and 3b to describe doubles and
                        triples, which is how often a team gets a hit and makes it to second and
                        third base respectively. It would make sense that these variables have a
                        strong impact on wins because a team should be more likely to win if they
                        have more opportunities on base, which may lead to more runs scored.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The defensive variables we thought would have the most effect on wins are
                        hits allowed, runs allowed, and earned runs. If a team has a high number of
                        hits allowed and a low number of earned runs, then we believe that the team
                        would have a high number of wins. We also hypothesized that if a team does
                        not allow many hits, walks, and runs, then they would have a better chance
                        of winning more often.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We did an initial analysis of descriptive measures for team wins in each of
                        the years. The table can be seen below. We found that wins are normally
                        distributed with a slight positive skewed and a wide degree of dispersion
                        (kurtosis). Mean, standard deviation, and variance do not seem to differ
                        too much from year to year.

                            The baseball team data for years 2014 and 2015 have various variables that
                            could potentially correlate with team/franchise wins, such as different
                            types of hits, overall hits, hits allowed, and many more. However, not all
                            the variables within this dataset fit our overall goals and purposes. For
                            example, the dataset contains repetitive nominal data that are qualitative,
                            such as variables for franchise, team, and retro. Therefore, sticking with
                            variables and attributes that are numerical and discrete will allows us to
                            further our analyses on different impactors of team/franchise wins. In
                            addition, to fit the scope of the project, we will be correlating 5
                            different variables for wins. We will begin with comparing offensive
                            variables/stats of different teams to see if there is actual statistical
                            evidence that shows the reason why teams are winning. A great variable to
                            begin with would be the total hits of each team. Through hypothesis
                            testing, if there is a linear relationship that appears for hits and wins,
                            then we will further our analysis on different types of hits; such as
                            double hits, triple hits, and homeruns. The next goal for our analysis will
                            be to investigate defensive variables/stats. We will instigate hits allowed
                            and then further our analysis with other defensive variables/stats, such as
                            runs allowed and earned runs. Lastly, we will determine if there is any
                            relation between overall attendance and wins.

                                show linear regression hypothesis testing through tools in Excel. Utilizing
                                scatter charts with linear trend lines and the regression/ANOVA tool for
                                R-squared and p-value identification will demonstrate and determine the
                                results of our overall analysis of impactors for wins. Furthermore, we will
                                be assuming that the null hypothesis (H0: β1 = 0) for the linear regression
                                stays true for all variable comparisons for wins, while rejecting the
                                alternative hypothesis (H1: β1 ≠ 0).
